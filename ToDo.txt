//to do:
    // animation for choke
    // animation for boss attack
    // fill the room with cooler assets
    // raycast some whiskers to avoid getting stuck on wall
    // damage effect for when enemy gets choked (maybe some screen shake?)
    // quick dialogue for when entering the room
    // quick dialogue when finishing
    // a panel on the wall to turn off the lighs and shrink the killers vision radius?
